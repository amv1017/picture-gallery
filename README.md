### Picture Gallery
##### To run backend execute command 'go run main.go' in 'cmd' folder and go to http://localhost:8080/
###### (If 'art-gallery-view' has been built and 'client' folder exists then web application running on http://localhost:8080/ is able to use frontend on the same URL)

##### To run frontend execute command 'npm install' & 'npm run start' in 'art-gallery-view' folder and go to http://localhost:3000/
##### For backend hot-reload mode use '~/go/bin/realize start' in 'cmd' folder in the case that **realize** package is installed with binaries.
